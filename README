Tyrant Game Engine
------------------

Compilation Instructions:

The included makefiles require specifying a build version and target processor architecture,
ex. make *target* BUILD=DEBUG ARCH=64 builds 64bit Tyrant with debug and profiling symbols,
make *target* BUILD=RELEASE ARCH=32 builds 32bit Tyrant with all symbols stripped from the binary
to minimize size, and a variety of compiler optimizations for speed. You have two options
for the target, either STATIC or SHARED depending on whether you want a static library or
shared object library. Simply running "make" will build a shared object release build with
the architecture of your operating system (or 32-bit on Windows).

*NOTE* The makefiles do not provide an install target, you will need to setup your projects'
compiler and linker search paths manually.

Linux:

Install the development version of the following packages

* opengl
* xlib
* xrandr
* freetype
* glew
* jpeg
* sndfile
* openal

Use the included Makefile (found in the Build Scripts folder) to build the library.


Windows:

MSVC has yet to complete full C++11 support as of
Visual Studio 2013. As a result, we support MinGW-w64 using
GCC 4.7 or greater (minimum). You can download the compiler
using the link in the Downloads section. Be sure to add
the bin folder to your systems path, then run mingw32-make
from the command line in the Build Scripts/Windows directory.

When running applications built with Tyrant, you'll need to ensure
then OpenAL and libsndfile dll's are in the same directory as the
executable. These dll's are found under the extlibs/bin/*ARCH* directory.


OS X:

Use the included Makefile (found in the Build Scripts folder) to build the library.
